# ruuviscanner

ruuviscanner is an application listening for RuuviTag broadcasts and converting them measurements suitable for storing in InfluxDB.

The code is inspired by https://github.com/Scrin/RuuviCollector, but I needed a more lightweight application that can run on
a [RaspberryPi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/).

## How to use?

TODO: Document how to use this application.
